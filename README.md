Time Series Forecasting for Electricity Consumption Data
Analyzing electricity usage (2015-2020) with ML & DL models. Includes EDA, ACF/PACF, trend analysis, a Naïve model, RandomForestRegressor, and an LSTM network. Evaluates MSE, RMSE, MAPE & R². Uses Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity consumption trends using a mix of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches.

🔹 Key Features
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Trends, seasonality, and correlation insights
✔️ Naïve Model – Baseline for performance comparison
✔️ RandomForestRegressor – Machine learning-based forecasting
✔️ LSTM Network – Deep learning-based time series prediction
✔️ Performance Metrics – MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² for accuracy evaluation
✔️ Data Visualization – Interactive plots using Matplotlib & Plotly
